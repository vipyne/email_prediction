notes to myself on beginning / pseudocode:

- create a file for data set hash.  (idea is to make this a modular item that can be changed/updated/swapped).

- create 4 methods for potential patterns that take the input (name, domain) and output email address.

- seperate out view (backend code the same whether run in terminal or web app)


1. take the input (name, domain)
2. check against data set hash
3. if no match return error message and all 4 potential patterns
4. collect all key value pairs that match domain and check against 4 potential patterns.
5. process input through appropriate method


advisor class
initialize with name and email


create a domains key?


get hash with only matching domains
run 4 methods on name
see which ones match value
